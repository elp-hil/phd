  abstract = {Pure parahydrogen (pH2) is the prerequisite for optimal pH2-based hyperpolarization experiments, promising approaches to access the hidden orders of magnitude of MR signals. pH2 production on-site in medical research centers is vital for the proliferation of these technologies in the life sciences. However, previously suggested designs do not meet our requirements for safety or production performance (flow rate, pressure or enrichment). In this article, we present the safety concept, design and installation of a pH2 converter, operated in a clinical setting. The apparatus produces a continuous flow of four standard liters per minute of {$\approx$}98\% enriched pH2 at a pressure maximum of 50\,bar. The entire production cycle, including cleaning and cooling to 25\,K, takes less than 5\,h, only {$\approx$}45 min of which are required for actual pH2 conversion. A fast and simple quantification procedure is described. The lifetimes of pH2 in a glass vial and aluminum storage cylinder are measured to be T1C(glass vial)\,=\,822\,{$\pm$}\,29\,min and T1C(Al cylinder)\,=\,129\,{$\pm$}\,36\,days, thus providing sufficiently long storage intervals and allowing the application of pH2 on demand. A dependence of line width on pH2 enrichment is observed. As examples, 1H hyperpolarization of pyridine and 13C hyperpolarization of hydroxyethylpropionate are presented.

  abstract = {Pyruvate is included in the energy production of the heart muscle and is metabolized into lactate, alanine, and CO2 in equilibrium with HCO. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using 13C hyperpolarization enhanced MRI to monitor pyruvate metabolism in the heart during an ischemic episode. The left circumflex artery of pigs (4 months, male, 29\textendash{}34 kg) was occluded for 15 or 45 min followed by 2 hr of reperfusion. Pigs were examined by 13C chemical shift imaging following intravenous injection of 1-13C pyruvate. 13C chemical shift MR imaging was used in order to visualize the local concentrations of the metabolites. After a 15-min occlusion (no infarct) the bicarbonate signal level in the affected area was reduced (25\textendash{}44\%) compared with the normal myocardium. Alanine signal level was normal. After a 45-min occlusion (infarction) the bicarbonate signal was almost absent (0.2\textendash{}11\%) and the alanine signal was reduced (27\textendash{}51\%). Due to image-folding artifacts the data obtained for lactate were inconclusive. These studies demonstrate that cardiac metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized 1-13C-pyruvate is feasible. The changes in concentrations of the metabolites within a minute after injection can be detected and metabolic maps constructed.

  abstract = {A new technique is proposed to carry out Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) experiments at high magnetic fields. SABRE is a method, which utilizes spin order transfer from para-hydrogen to the spins of a substrate in transient complexes using suitable catalysts. Such a transfer of spin order is efficient at low magnetic fields, notably, in the Level Anti-Crossing (LAC) regions. Here it is demonstrated that LAC conditions can also be fulfilled at high fields in the rotating reference frame under the action of an RF-field. Spin mixing at LACs allows one to polarize substrates at high fields as well; the achievable NMR enhancements are around 360 for the ortho-protons of partially deuterated pyridine used as a substrate and around 700 for H2 and substrate in the active complex with the catalyst. High-field SABRE effects have also been found for several other molecules containing a nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring.},

This Minireview tracks the development of SABRE from the initial hyperpolarization of pyridine in 2009 to the point in which 50 \% 1H polarization levels have been achieved in a di-deuterio-nicotinate, a key step in the pathway to potential clinical use. Simple routes to highly efficient 15N hyperpolarization and the creation of hyperpolarized long-lived magnetic states are illustrated. To conclude, we describe how the recently reported SABRE-RELAY approach offers a route for parahydrogen to hyperpolarize a much wider array of molecular scaffolds, such as amides, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and phosphates, than was previously thought possible. We predict that collectively these developments ensure that SABRE will significantly impact on both chemical analysis and the diagnosis of disease in the future.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging is very low because the detected signal strength depends on the small population difference between spin states even in high magnetic fields. Hyperpolarization methods can be used to increase this difference and thereby enhance signal strength. This has been achieved previously by incorporating the molecular spin singlet para-hydrogen into hydrogenation reaction products. We show here that a metal complex can facilitate the reversible interaction of para-hydrogen with a suitable organic substrate such that up to an 800-fold increase in proton, carbon, and nitrogen signal strengths are seen for the substrate without its hydrogenation. These polarized signals can be selectively detected when combined with methods that suppress background signals.
The nuclear spin polarization of para-hydrogen can be transferred to organic molecules when both bind to a metal complex.

The dependence of the polarization on microwave frequency, radical concentration and electron saturation was studied. For optimized conditions, a 13C polarization equal to 64{$\pm$}5\% was obtained, an increase by more than a factor of two compared with earlier results at 3.35T of the same system. It was furthermore observed that the addition of gadolinium, which resulted in a twofold polarization increase at 3.35T, only resulted in a minor improvement at 4.64T. The dependence of the electron saturation on microwave frequency and microwave power was quantified by first moment measurements which were obtained by nucleus\textendash{}electron double resonance (NEDOR) experiments. Complete electron saturation was observed for a microwave frequency close to the centre frequency of the ESR line, and by using maximum power of the microwave source. The DNP build-up time at 4.64T ({$\sim$}3000s) was prolonged by approximately a factor three over the build-up time at 3.35T ({$\sim$}1200s).

  abstract = {A method is proposed for significant improvement of NMR pulse sequences used in high-field SABRE (Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange) experiments. SABRE makes use of spin order transfer from parahydrogen (pH2, the H2 molecule in its singlet spin state) to a substrate in a transient organometallic Ir-based complex. The technique proposed here utilizes ``re-polarization'', i.e., multiple application of an NMR pulse sequence used for spin order transfer. During re-polarization only the form of the substrate, which is bound to the complex, is excited by selective NMR pulses and the resulting polarization is transferred to the free substrate via chemical exchange. Owing to the fact that (i) only a small fraction of the substrate molecules is in the bound form and (ii) spin relaxation of the free substrate is slow, the re-polarization scheme provides greatly improved NMR signal enhancement, {$\epsilon$}. For instance, when pyridine is used as a substrate, single use of the SABRE-INEPT sequence provides {$\epsilon\approx$}260 for 15N nuclei, whereas SABRE-INEPT with re-polarization yields {$\epsilon{}>$}2000. We anticipate that the proposed method is useful for achieving maximal NMR enhancement with spin hyperpolarization techniques.},

  volume = {15},
  issn = {1076-6332},
  abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Hyperpolarized gases such as 129Xe and 3He have high potential as imaging agents for functional lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We present new technology offering 129Xe production rates with order-of-magnitude improvement over existing systems, to liter per hour at 50\% polarization. Human lung imaging studies with xenon, initially limited by the modest quantity and quality of hyperpolarized gas available, can now be performed with multiliter quantities several times daily.
Materials and Methods
The polarizer is a continuous-flow system capable of producing large quantities of highly-polarized 129Xe through rubidium spin-exchange optical pumping. The low-pressure, high-velocity operating regime takes advantage of the enhancement in the spin exchange rate provided by van der Waals molecules dominating the atomic interactions. The long polarizing column moves the flow of the gas opposite to the laser direction, allowing efficient extraction of the laser light. Separate sections of the system assure full rubidium vapor saturation and removal.
Results
The system is capable of producing 64\% polarization at 0.3 L/hour Xe production rate. Increasing xenon flow reduces output polarization. Xenon polarization was studied as a function of different system operating parameters. A novel xenon trapping design was demonstrated to allow full recovery of the xenon polarization after the freeze-thaw cycle. Delivery methods of the gas to an offsite MRI facility were demonstrated in both frozen and gas states.
Conclusions
We demonstrated a new concept for producing large quantities of highly polarized xenon. The system is operating in an MRI facility producing liters of hyperpolarized gas for human lung imaging studies.},

  volume = {137},

  abstract = {Hyperpolarization (HP) of nuclear spins is critical for ultrasensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We demonstrate an approach for {$>$}1500-fold enhancement of key small-molecule metabolites: 1-13C-pyruvic acid, 1-13C-sodium lactate, and 1-13C-acetic acid. The 13C solution NMR signal of pyruvic acid was enhanced 1600-fold at B = 1 T and 40 \textdegree{}C by pre-polarizing at 14 T and {$\sim$}2.3 K. This ``brute-force'' approach uses only field and temperature to generate HP. The noted 1 T observation field is appropriate for benchtop NMR and near the typical 1.5 T of MRI, whereas high-field observation scales enhancement as 1/B. Our brute-force process ejects the frozen, solid sample from the low-T, high-B polarizer, passing it through low field (B {$<$} 100 G) to facilitate ``thermal mixing''. That equilibrates 1H and 13C in hundreds of milliseconds, providing 13C HP from 1H Boltzmann polarization attained at high B/T. The ejected sample arrives at a room-temperature, permanent magnet array, where rapid dissolution with 40 \textdegree{}C water yields HP solute. Transfer to a 1 T NMR system yields 13C signals with enhancements at 80\% of ideal for noted polarizing conditions. High-resolution NMR of the same product at 9.4 T had consistent enhancement plus resolution of 13C shifts and J-couplings for pyruvic acid and its hydrate. Comparable HP was achieved with frozen aqueous lactate, plus notable enhancement of acetic acid, demonstrating broader applicability for small-molecule NMR and metabolic MRI. Brute-force avoids co-solvated free-radicals and microwaves that are essential to competing methods. Here, unadulterated samples obviate concerns about downstream purity and also exhibit slow solid-state spin relaxation, favorable for transporting HP samples.},

  abstract = {The continuous re-hyperpolarization of nuclear spins in the liquid state by means of parahydrogen (para-H2) and chemical exchange at low magnetic fields was recently discovered and offers intriguing perspectives for many varieties of magnetic resonance. In this contribution, we provide a theoretical assessment of this effect and compare the results to experimental data. A distinct distribution of polarization is found, which shares some features with experimental data and, interestingly, does not directly correspond to the loss of the singlet order of para-H2. We derived expressions for the magnetic field and para-H2-substrate interaction time, for which the polarization transfer is maximal. This work sheds light onto the effect of continuous hyperpolarization and elucidates the underlying mechanism, which may facilitate the development of an optimized catalyst. As an application, continuous hyperpolarization may enable highly sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance at very low magnetic fields, for example, for the cost-efficient screening of drugs.},
