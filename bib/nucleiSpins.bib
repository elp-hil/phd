  abstract = {Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Second  Edition is a comprehensive and modern introduction which  focuses on those essential principles and concepts needed for a  thorough understanding of the subject, rather than the practical  aspects. The quantum theory of nuclear magnets is presented within  a strong physical framework, supported by figures.~   The book assumes only a basic knowledge of complex numbers and  matrices, and provides the reader with numerous worked examples and  exercises to encourage understanding. With the explicit aim of  carefully developing the subject from the beginning, the text  starts with coverage of quarks and nucleons and progresses through  to a detailed explanation of several important NMR experiments,  including NMR imaging, COSY, NOESY and TROSY.~  Completely revised and updated, the Second Edition features new  material on the properties and distributions of isotopes, chemical  shift anisotropy and quadrupolar interactions, Pake patterns, spin  echoes, slice selection in NMR imaging, and a complete new chapter  on the NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei. New appendices have  been included on Euler angles, and coherence selection by field  gradients. As in the first edition, all material is heavily  supported by graphics, much of which is new to this  edition.~  Written for undergraduates and postgraduate students taking a  first course in NMR spectroscopy and for those needing an  up-to-date account of the subject, this multi-disciplinary book  will appeal to chemical, physical, material, life, medical, earth  and environmental scientists. The detailed physical insights will  also make the book of interest for experienced spectroscopists and  NMR researchers.~  \textbullet{} An accessible and carefully written introduction,  designed to help students to fully understand this complex and  dynamic subject  \textbullet{} Takes a multi-disciplinary approach, focusing on basic  principles and concepts rather than the more practical aspects  \textbullet{} Presents a strong pedagogical approach throughout, with  emphasis placed on individual spins to aid understanding  \textbullet{} Includes numerous worked examples, problems, further  reading and additional notes  Praise from the reviews of the First Edition:  This is an excellent book... that many teachers of NMR  spectroscopy will cherish... It deserves to be a  `classic' among NMR spectroscopy texts. NMR  IN BIOMEDICINE  I strongly recommend this book to everyone\ldots{}it is  probably the best modern comprehensive description of the  subject. ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE, INTERNATIONAL EDITION},

It is shown that a radiofrequency field at right angles to the constant field causes a forced precession of the total polarization around the constant field with decreasing latitude as the Larmor frequency approaches adiabatically the frequency of the r-f field. Thus there results a component of the nuclear polarization at right angles to both the constant and the r-f field and it is shown that under normal laboratory conditions this component can induce observable voltages. In Section 3 we discuss this nuclear induction, considering the effect of external fields only, while in Section 4 those modifications are described which originate from internal fields and finite relaxation times.},

After a brief description of the mathematical tools, namely `average Hamiltonian theory' and `product operator description' of density operator treatments of nuclear spin systems, several one dimensional scaling experiments have been analysed. Extending to two dimensions, the versatility of scaling manipulations in the experimental scheme of 2D NMR spectroscopy has been demonstrated. Specific pulse sequences designed to scale the chemical shifts, coupling constants and line widths in three different categories of 2D NMR spectroscopy, namely J-resolved spectroscopy, correlated spectroscopy and multiple quantum spectroscopy, have been discussed. It has been shown that for optimisation of sensitivity and resolution in 2D spectra, the scaling requirements are different in the three different kinds of experiments. At every stage the merits and demerits of the scaling experiments have been discussed. Apart from the generalised applications in sensitivity and resolution enhancements, specific applications in observation of long range correlations, measurement of coupling constants and measurement of exchange (or cross relaxation) rates have been discussed. We believe that this general exposition should enable the NMR spectroscopists to select a suitable pulse scheme and optimise the scaling factors to derive specific results on the systems of interest.},

Among these methods are para-hydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) and signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE), which exploit the strong nuclear alignment of para-hydrogen. Several SABRE experiments have been reported but, so far, it has not been possible to account for the experimentally observed sign and magnetic-field dependence of substrate polarization. Herein, we present an analysis based on level anti-crossings (LACs), which provides a complete understanding of the SABRE effect. The field-dependence of both net and anti-phase polarization is measured for several ligands, which can be reproduced by the theory. The similar SABRE field-dependence for different ligands is also explained. In general, the LAC concept allows complex spin dynamics to be unraveled, and is crucial for optimizing the performance of novel hyperpolarization methods in NMR and MRI techniques.},

  abstract = {Nuclear spin hyperpolarization is an important resource for increasing the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy and MRI. Signal enhancements can be as large as 3\textendash{}4 orders of magnitude. In hyperpolarization experiments, it is often desirable to transfer the initial polarization to other nuclei of choice, either protons or insensitive nuclei such as 13C and 15N. This situation arises primarily in Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (CIDNP), Para-Hydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP), and the related Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE). Here we review the recent literature on polarization transfer mechanisms, in particular focusing on the role of Level Anti-Crossings (LACs) therein. So-called ``spontaneous'' polarization transfer may occur both at low and high magnetic fields. In addition, transfer of spin polarization can be accomplished by using especially designed pulse sequences. It is now clear that at low field spontaneous polarization transfer is primarily due to coherent spin-state mixing under strong coupling conditions. However, thus far the important role of LACs in this process has not received much attention. At high magnetic field, polarization may be transferred by cross-relaxation effects. Another promising high-field technique is to generate the strong coupling condition by spin locking using strong radio-frequency fields. Here, an analysis of polarization transfer in terms of LACs in the rotating frame is very useful to predict which spin orders are transferred depending on the strength and frequency of the B1 field. Finally, we will examine the role of strong coupling and LACs in magnetic-field dependent nuclear spin relaxation and the related topic of long-lived spin-states.},

In these experiments, 1H enhancements of up to 170{$\pm$}50 have been observed in 1-13C-glycine dispersed in a 60:40 glycerol/water matrix at temperatures of 20K; in addition, we have observed significant enhancements in 15N spectra of unoriented pf1-bacteriophage.

In all cases, we have exploited the thermal mixing DNP mechanism with the nitroxide radical 4-amino-TEMPO as the paramagnetic dopant. These are the highest frequency DNP experiments performed to date and indicate that significant signal enhancements can be realized using the thermal mixing mechanism even at elevated magnetic fields.

The chapters have been written by leading experts in a given area, but with a wider audience in mind.The result is the standard reference on the topic, serving as a guide to the best computational methods for any given problem, and is thus an indispensable tool for scientists using quantum chemical calculations of NMR and EPR parameters.A must-have for all chemists, physicists, biologists and materials scientists who wish to augment their research by quantum chemical calculations of magnetic resonance data, but who are not necessarily specialists in these methods or their applications. Furthermore, specialists in one of the subdomains of this wide field will be grateful to find here an overview of what lies beyond their own area of focus.},

  abstract = {Magnetic shielding is interesting in static fields and in alternating fields up to circa 10kHz. Formulas of the shielding factors for single- and double-walled spherical and cylindrical shells are given, in the latter case also for fields longitudinal to the axes (double-walled shells only for static fields). For cylinders with open ends the shielding factors are represented up to 1kHz for transverse and up to 10kHz for longitudinal fields. In alternating fields interesting resonance effects are observed. Suggestions for practical application are given. Texture materials show an anomalous frequency characteristic of the shielding factor; different models for this effect are discussed. In one of these models the shielding factors of grids are treated.},
