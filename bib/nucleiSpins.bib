	abstract = {The theory of the Zeeman splitting of the pure quadrupole energy levels for nuclei of half-integral spin is given in a form that is correct for any electric field gradient. The splitting of the spectra is discussed, and also the simplifications that can be made in the theory when the magnetic field is parallel to any of the three principal axes of the electric field gradient. For spin 32 it is shown that the deviation of the gradient from cylindrical symmetry can be determined from the Zeeman spectrum, and detailed calculations are given for this case, along with a discussion of their experimental application.},

	abstract = {The book is devoted to the description of the fundamentals in the area of magnetic resonance. The book covers two domains: radiospectroscopy and quantum radioelectronics. Radiospectroscopy comprises nuclear magnetic resonance , electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear quadrupolar resonance, and some other phenomena. The radiospectroscopic methods are widely used for obtaining the information on internal (nano, micro and macro) structure of objects. Quantum radioelectronics, which was developed on the basis of radiospectroscopic methods, deals with processes in quantum amplifiers, generators and magnetometers. We do not know analogues of the book presented. The book implies a few levels of the general consideration of phenomena, that can be useful for different groups of readers (students, PhD students, scientists from other scientific branches: physics, chemistry, physical chemistry, biochemistry, biology and medicine).},

	abstract = {Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Second  Edition is a comprehensive and modern introduction which  focuses on those essential principles and concepts needed for a  thorough understanding of the subject, rather than the practical  aspects. The quantum theory of nuclear magnets is presented within  a strong physical framework, supported by figures.    The book assumes only a basic knowledge of complex numbers and  matrices, and provides the reader with numerous worked examples and  exercises to encourage understanding. With the explicit aim of  carefully developing the subject from the beginning, the text  starts with coverage of quarks and nucleons and progresses through  to a detailed explanation of several important NMR experiments,  including NMR imaging, COSY, NOESY and TROSY.   Completely revised and updated, the Second Edition features new  material on the properties and distributions of isotopes, chemical  shift anisotropy and quadrupolar interactions, Pake patterns, spin  echoes, slice selection in NMR imaging, and a complete new chapter  on the NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei. New appendices have  been included on Euler angles, and coherence selection by field  gradients. As in the first edition, all material is heavily  supported by graphics, much of which is new to this  edition.   Written for undergraduates and postgraduate students taking a  first course in NMR spectroscopy and for those needing an  up-to-date account of the subject, this multi-disciplinary book  will appeal to chemical, physical, material, life, medical, earth  and environmental scientists. The detailed physical insights will  also make the book of interest for experienced spectroscopists and  NMR researchers.   • An accessible and carefully written introduction,  designed to help students to fully understand this complex and  dynamic subject  • Takes a multi-disciplinary approach, focusing on basic  principles and concepts rather than the more practical aspects  • Presents a strong pedagogical approach throughout, with  emphasis placed on individual spins to aid understanding  • Includes numerous worked examples, problems, further  reading and additional notes  Praise from the reviews of the First Edition:  This is an excellent book... that many teachers of NMR  spectroscopy will cherish... It deserves to be a  ‘classic’ among NMR spectroscopy texts. NMR  IN BIOMEDICINE  I strongly recommend this book to everyone…it is  probably the best modern comprehensive description of the  subject.

	abstract = {The magnetic moments of nuclei in normal matter will result in a nuclear paramagnetic polarization upon establishment of equilibrium in a constant magnetic field. It is shown that a radiofrequency field at right angles to the constant field causes a forced precession of the total polarization around the constant field with decreasing latitude as the Larmor frequency approaches adiabatically the frequency of the r-f field. Thus there results a component of the nuclear polarization at right angles to both the constant and the r-f field and it is shown that under normal laboratory conditions this component can induce observable voltages. In Section 3 we discuss this nuclear induction, considering the effect of external fields only, while in Section 4 those modifications are described which originate from internal fields and finite relaxation times.},
