  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on gradient echoes is used in a wide variety of imaging techniques and clinical applications. Gradient echo sequences form the basis for an essential group of imaging methods that find widespread use in clinical practice, particularly when fast imaging is important, as for example in cardiac MRI or contrast-enhanced MR angiography. However, the term "gradient echo sequence" is somewhat unspecific, as even images acquired with the most common sequences employing the gradient echo for data acquisition can significantly differ in signal, contrast, artifact behavior, and sensitivity to, eg, flow. This is due to the different use of sequence timing and basic sequence building blocks such as spoiler gradients or specific radiofrequency (RF) pulse phase patterns. In this article the basic principles of gradient echo formation compared to spin echo imaging are reviewed and the properties of gradient echo imaging in its simplest form (TR {$\gg$} T(2)) are described. Further, the most common three variants of fast gradient echo sequences (TR {$<$} T(2)), namely, unbalanced gradient echo, RF spoiled gradient echo, and balanced steady state free precession; are discussed. For each gradient echo sequence type, examples of applications exploiting the specific properties of the individual technique are presented.},

Methods A gradient coil with a high number of individual elements was designed. Dimensions of the coil were chosen to mimic a whole-body gradient system, scaled down to a head insert. Mechanical shape and wire layout of each element were optimized to increase the local gradient strength while minimizing eddy current effects and simultaneously considering manufacturing constraints. Results Resulting wire layout and mechanical design is presented. A prototype matrix gradient coil with 12 \texttimes{} 7 = 84 elements consisting of two element types was realized and characterized. Measured eddy currents are {$<$}1\% of the original field. The coil is shown to be capable of creating nonlinear, and linear SEMs. In a DSV of 0.22 m gradient strengths between 24 mT{$\slash$}m and 78 mT{$\slash$}m could be realized locally with maximum currents of 150 A. Initial proof-of-concept imaging experiments using linear and nonlinear encoding fields are demonstrated.

The three dominant tissue-specific parameters discussed are proton density, longitudinal relaxation time T1, and transverse relaxation time T2. For the utilization of gradient-echo sequences, transverse relaxation time T2* is introduced, more dependent on the environment or tissue interfaces than on the tissue itself. Another tissue-specific parameter is the concentration of macromolecules and their hydration layers as targeted with magnetization transfer imaging. Still another tissue-specific parameter is the chemical environment. Functional parameters that influence the contrast are diffusion, perfusion, flow, or motion. The sequence-related utilization of these tissue-specific parameters start with magnetization preparation as in spectral suppression of fat signal, relaxation-dependent elimination of fat or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal, simple inversion pulse, magnetization transfer saturation, or diffusion weighting. Possible contrast mechanisms for the tissue-specific parameters are discussed for each of the commonly used sequences, whether of spin-echo type or of gradient-echo type, with or without magnetization preparation, conventional single-echo acquisition, or contemporary multiecho acquisition.},

Experiments were performed on different Gd-doped water phantoms and on humans. T1 values derived from inversion recovery TrueFISP were in excellent agreement with the single-point method even for flip angles up to 50\textdegree.

  abstract = {Purpose: 
To enable three-dimensional (3D) vocal tract imaging of dynamic singing or speech tasks at voxel sizes of 1.6 \texttimes{} 1.6 \texttimes{} 1.3 mm3at 1.3 s per image.

Materials and methods:
A Stack-of-Stars method was implemented and enhanced to allow for fast and efficient k-space sampling of the box-shaped vocal tract using a 3 Tesla MRI system. Images were reconstructed using an off-line image reconstruction using compressed sensing theory, leading to the abovementioned spatial and temporal resolutions. To validate spatial resolution, a phantom with holes of defined sizes was measured. The applicability of the imaging method was validated in an eight-subject study of amateur singers that were required to sustain phonation at a constant pitch, past their comfortable expiratory level. A segmentation of the vocal tract over all phonation time steps was done for one subject. Anatomical distances (larynx position and pharynx width) were calculated and compared for all subjects.

Results:
Analysis of the phantom study revealed that the imaging method could provide at least 1.6 mm isotropic resolution. Visual inspection of the segmented vocal tract during phonation showed modifications of the lips, tongue, and larynx position in all three dimensions. The mean larynx position per subject amounted to 52-85 mm, deviating up to 5\% over phonation time. Parameter pharynx width was 32-181 mm2on average per subject, deviating up to 16\% over phonation time. Visual inspection of the parameter course revealed no common compensation strategy for long sustained phonation.

Conclusion:
The results of both phantom and in vivo measurements show the applicability of the fast 3D imaging method for voice research and indicate that modifications in all three dimensions can be observed and quantified.

Atrophy of medial temporal structures is now considered to be a valid diagnostic marker at the mild cognitive impairment stage. Structural imaging is also included in diagnostic criteria for the most prevalent non-Alzheimer dementias, reflecting its value in differential diagnosis. In addition, rates of whole-brain and hippocampal atrophy are sensitive markers of neurodegeneration, and are increasingly used as outcome measures in trials of potentially disease-modifying therapies. Large multicenter studies are currently investigating the value of other imaging and nonimaging markers as adjuncts to clinical assessment in diagnosis and monitoring of progression.

Rapid progress has been made in cardiac MRI (CMRI) over the past decade, which has firmly established it as a reliable and clinically important technique for assessment of cardiac structure, function, perfusion, and myocardial viability. Its versatility and accuracy is unmatched by any other individual imaging modality. CMRI is non-invasive and has high spatial resolution and avoids use of potentially nephrotoxic contrast agent or radiation. It has been extensively studied against other established non-invasive imaging modalities and has been shown to be superior in many scenarios, particularly with respect to assessment of cardiac and great vessel morphology and left ventricular function. Furthermore, its clinical use continues to expand with increasing experience and proliferation of CMRI centres. As worldwide prevalence of cardiovascular disease continues to rise, CMRI provides opportunity for improved and cost-effective non-invasive assessment. Continued progress in CMRI technology promises to further widen its clinical application in coronary imaging, myocardial perfusion, comprehensive assessment of valves, and plaque characterisation.},

  issn = {1364-5706},
  abstract = {The paper reports an important achievement in MRI instrumentation, a pneumatic, fully actuated robot located within the scanner alongside the patient and operating under remote control based on the images. Previous MRI robots commonly used piezoelectric actuation limiting their compatibility. Pneumatics is an ideal choice for MRI compatibility because it is decoupled from electromagnetism, but pneumatic actuators were hardly controllable. This achievement was possible due to a recent technology breakthrough, the invention of a new type of pneumatic motor, PneuStep , designed for the robot reported here with uncompromised MRI compatibility, high-precision, and medical safety. MrBot is one of the ``MRI stealth'' robots today (the second is described in this issue by Zangos et al.). Both of these systems are also multi-imager compatible, being able to operate with the imager of choice or cross-imaging modalities. For MRI compatibility the robot is exclusively constructed of nonmagnetic and dielectric materials such as plastics, ceramics, crystals, rubbers and is electricity free. Light-based encoding is used for feedback, so that all electric components are distally located outside the imager's room. MRI robots are modern, digital medical instruments in line with advanced imaging equipment and methods. These allow for accessing patients within closed bore scanners and performing interventions under direct (in scanner) imaging feedback. MRI robots could allow e.g. to biopsy small lesions imaged with cutting edge cancer imaging methods, or precisely deploy localized therapy at cancer foci. Our robot is the first to show the feasibility of fully automated in-scanner interventions. It is customized for the prostate and operates transperineally for needle interventions. It can accommodate various needle drivers for different percutaneous procedures such as biopsy, thermal ablations, or brachytherapy. The first needle driver is customized for fully automated low-dose radiation seed brachytherapy. This paper gives an introduction to the challenges of MRI robot compatibility and presents the solutions adopted in making the MrBot. Its multi-imager compatibility and other preclinical tests are included. The robot shows the technical feasibility of MRI-guided prostate interventions, yet its clinical utility is still to be determined.},

  issn = {2473-4209},
  abstract = {Purpose Magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequences are commonly employed for T1-weighted structural brain imaging. Following a contrast preparation radiofrequency (RF) pulse, the data acquisition proceeds under nonequilibrium conditions of the relaxing longitudinal magnetization. Variation of the flip angle can be used to maximize total available signal. Simulated annealing or greedy algorithms have so far been published to numerically solve this problem, with signal-to-noise ratios optimized for clinical imaging scenarios by adhering to a predefined shape of the signal evolution. We propose an unconstrained optimization of the MPRAGE experiment that employs techniques from resource allocation theory. A new dynamic programming solution is introduced that yields closed-form expressions for optimal flip angle variation. Methods Flip angle series are proposed that maximize total transverse magnetization () for a range of physiologic T1 values. A 3D MPRAGE sequence is modified to allow for a controlled variation of the excitation angle. Experiments employing a T1 contrast phantom are performed at 3T. 1D acquisitions without phase encoding permit measurement of the temporal development of . Image mean signal and standard deviation for reference flip angle trains are compared in 2D measurements. Signal profiles at sharp phantom edges are acquired to access image blurring related to nonuniform development. Results A novel closed-form expression for flip angle variation is found that constitutes the optimal policy to reach maximum total signal. It numerically equals previously published results of other authors when evaluated under their simplifying assumptions. Longitudinal magnetization () is exhaustively used without causing abrupt changes in the measured MR signal, which is a prerequisite for artifact free images. Phantom experiments at 3T verify the expected benefit for total accumulated k-space signal when compared with published flip angle series. Conclusions Describing the MR signal collection in MPRAGE sequences as a Bellman problem is a new concept. By means of recursively solving a series of overlapping subproblems, this leads to an elegant solution for the problem of maximizing total available MR signal in k-space. A closed-form expression for flip angle variation avoids the complexity of numerical optimization and eases access to controlled variation in an attempt to identify potential clinical applications.},

  abstract = {A steady-state free precession technique for observing nuclear magnetic resonance is described. A mathematical analysis is presented for certain special conditions, and initial experiments verifying the results of this analysis are reported. This technique provides two opportunities for improving the signal-to-noise ratio. First, it provides a mechanism, similar to that of the "spin echo," for eliminating the effect of the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field on signal strength. This permits the effective use of larger samples. In the second place it provides a steady-state signal which can be observed with a narrow-band detector. Under certain conditions the technique has a broad response as a function of frequency or field. The upper limit to the width of this response is determined by the electronic apparatus supplying the rf pulses rather than the magnet or the nuclear sample.},
