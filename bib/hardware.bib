Nuclear spins are manipulated to an uncertainty of {$\pm$}1\textdegree{} by means of pulses, which can be arranged in an arbitrary combination. As a demonstration, standard experiments for the measurement of relaxation parameters of thermally polarized samples were implemented.

  abstract = {Background
This article explains some simple experiments that can be used in undergraduate or graduate physics or biomedical engineering laboratory classes to learn how birdcage volume radiofrequency (RF) coils and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) work. For a clear picture, and to do any quantitative MRI analysis, acquiring images with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is required. With a given MRI system at a given field strength, the only means to change the SNR using hardware is to change the RF coil used to collect the image. RF coils can be designed in many different ways including birdcage volume RF coil designs. The choice of RF coil to give the best SNR for any MRI study is based on the sample being imaged.

Results
The data collected in the simple experiments show that the SNR varies as inverse diameter for the birdcage volume RF coils used in these experiments. The experiments were easily performed by a high school student, an undergraduate student, and a graduate student, in less than 3 h, the time typically allotted for a university laboratory course.

Conclusions
The article describes experiments that students in undergraduate or graduate laboratories can perform to observe how birdcage volume RF coils influence MRI measurements. It is designed for students interested in pursuing careers in the imaging field.},

It is an interdisciplinary research spanning biology and medicine with the engineering in generation and measurement of electromagnetic fields. The aim of the study consists in the analysis of parameters estimations and measurements of extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF MF) as well as exposure systems parameters in biomedical research. Material and Methods: Experiments were performed on 2 most popular low magnetic field exposure systems: the solenoid and Helmholtz coils. A theoretical analysis and a measurement verification of the magnetic field distribution inside the systems were carried out to evaluate the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Additional factors, vibrations and temperature changes, affecting the assessment of the biological effects of magnetic field exposure were also examined. Results: Based on the study results, a comparative analysis of solenoids and Helmholtz coils as the magnetic field exposure systems was presented. Proposals for the description of magnetic field exposure were also formulated. Conclusions: The authors emphasize the importance of a conscious choice of exposure conditions and their explicit description. These are fundamental requirements for both the reproduction of experimental conditions and the verification of results. Med. Pr. 2015;66(2):185\textendash{}197},

This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity\textemdash{}which cannot be explained by weak electron\textendash{}phonon interactions\textemdash{}in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1\textdegree\textemdash{}the first `magic' angle\textemdash{}the electronic band structure of this `twisted bilayer graphene' exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature\textendash{}carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

The device enables field variation over several decades (from 100{$\mu$}T up to 7T) within less than 0.3s; progress in NMR probe design provides NMR linewidths of about 10-3ppm. The experimental method is very versatile and enables site-specific studies of spin relaxation (NMRD, LLSs) and spin hyperpolarization (DNP, CIDNP, and SABRE) at variable magnetic field and at variable temperature. Experimental examples of such studies are demonstrated; advantages of the experimental method are described and existing challenges in the field are outlined.},

A framework was derived for optimization of local orthogonality within the physical boundaries and geometric constraints. Spatial encoding of magnetic fields was optimized for their local orthogonality over a large field of view.ResultsA coil design consisting of straight wire segments was optimized, implemented, and integrated into a 3T human scanner to show the feasibility of this approach. Initial MR images are shown and further applications of the derived optimization method and the nonlinear planar gradient system are discussed.ConclusionEncoding fields generated by the prototype encoding system were shown to be locally orthogonal and able to encode a cylindrical volume sufficient for some abdomen imaging applications for humans.},
