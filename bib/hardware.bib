  abstract = {This chapter describes a number of general applications suitable for quantifying the requirements of universal active devices or operational amplifiers. The transfer of each example is described by a matrix containing, firstly, one or more nominal values, and secondly, error terms having low values. The nominal values are determined by the circuit configuration and by the gain-setting passive components in the circuit. The error terms are determined by the nonidealities of the active devices as discussed in Chap. 2.},

  abstract = {Analytical expressions correlating the volumetric flow rate to the inlet and outlet pressures are derived for the time-independent flow of Newtonian fluids in cylindrically-shaped elastic tubes using a one-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow model with two pressure-area constitutive relations. These expressions for elastic tubes are the equivalent of Poiseuille and Poiseuille-type expressions for rigid tubes which were previously derived for the flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids under various flow conditions. Formulae and procedures for identifying the pressure field and tube geometric profile are also presented. The results are validated by a finite element method implementation. Sensible trends in the analytical and numerical results are observed and documented.},

  abstract = {ObjectThe design of a multinuclear low-field NMR unit with variable field strength {$<$}6 mT providing accurate spin manipulations and sufficient sensitivity for direct detection of samples in thermal equilibrium to aid parahydrogen-based hyperpolarization experiments.Materials and methodsAn optimized, resistive magnet connected to a battery or wall-power driven current source was constructed to provide a magnetic field {$<$}6 mT. A digital device connected to a saddle-shaped transmit- and solenoid receive-coil enabled MR signal excitation and detection with up to 106 samples/s, controlled by a flexible pulse-programming software.ResultsThe magnetization of thermally polarized samples at 1.8 and 5.7 mT is detected in a single acquisition with a SNR {$\approx$}101 and {$\approx$}102 and a line width of 42 and 32 Hz, respectively. Nuclear spins are manipulated to an uncertainty of {$\pm$}1\textdegree{} by means of pulses, which can be arranged in an arbitrary combination. As a demonstration, standard experiments for the measurement of relaxation parameters of thermally polarized samples were implemented. The detection of much stronger hyperpolarized signal was exemplified employing parahydrogen.ConclusionDirect detection of thermal and hyperpolarized 1H-MR signal in a single acquisition and accurate spin manipulations at 1.8 and 5.5 mT were successfully demonstrated.},

  abstract = {A fresh approach to the calculation of signal-to-noise ratio, using the Principle of Reciprocity, is formulated. The method is shown, for a solenoidal receiving coil, to give the same results as the traditional method of calculation, but its advantage lies in its ability to predict the ratio for other coil configurations. Particular attention is paid to the poor performance of a saddle-shaped (or Helmholtz) coil. Some of the practical problems involved are also discussed, including the error of matching the probe to the input impedance of the preamplifier.},
