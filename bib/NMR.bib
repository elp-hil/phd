  volume = {51},
  abstract = {The nonadiabatic transitions which a system with angular momentum J makes in a magnetic field which is rotating about an axis inclined with respect to the field are calculated. It is shown that the effects depend on the sign of the magnetic moment of the system. We therefore have an absolute method for measuring the sign and magnitude of the moment of any system. Applications to the magnetic moment of the neutron, the rotational moment of molecules, and the nuclear moment of atoms with no extra-nuclear angular momentum are discussed.},

  abstract = {A computerised approach to the structural analysis of unbranched regular polysaccharides is described, which is based on an evaluation of the 13C-n.m.r. spectra for all possible primary structures within the additive scheme starting from the chemical shifts of the 13C resonances of the constituent monosaccharides and the average values of the glycosylation effects. The analysis reveals a structure (or structures), the evaluated spectrum of which resembles most closely that observed. The approach has been verified by using a series of bacterial polysaccharides of known structure and, in combination with methylation analysis data, for the determination of the presently unknown structures of the O-specific polysaccharides from Salmonella arizonae O59 and O63, and Proteus hauseri O19.},

This book evaluates the practical application of pulse methods and the necessary instrumentation.Organized into seven chapters, this book begins with an overview of the NMR fundamentals and the basic pulse methods. This text then summarizes the important features of pulse spectrometers. Other chapters consider the rationale, the advantages, and the limitations of Fourier transform NMR methods. This book discusses as well how the idea of the rotating frame can be utilized to understand certain experiments that extend the range of application of pulse methods. The final chapter deals with a few significant special uses of pulse techniques.This book is a valuable resource for chemists and readers who are familiar with high resolution NMR but with no background in pulse methods.},
