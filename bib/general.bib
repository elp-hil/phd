  abstract = {These lecture notes on electromagnetism have evolved from graduate and undergraduate EM theory courses given by the author at the University of Rochester, with the basics presented with clarity and his characteristic attention to detail.The thirteen chapters cover, in logical sequence, topics ranging from electrostatics, magnetostatics and Maxwell\&\#39;s equations to plasmas and radiation. Boundary value problems are treated extensively, as are wave guides, electromagnetic interactions and fields. This second edition comprises many of the topics expanded with more details on the derivation of various equations, particularly in the second half of the book that focuses on rather advanced topics.This set of lecture notes, written in a simple and lucid style and in a manner that is complementary to other texts on electromagnetism, will be a valuable addition to the physics bookshelf.},

The methods of evaluating the catalyst activity in OPC and calculations of the performance of hydrogen liquefiers are given. The most important papers that deal with the use of catalysts of OPC under the conditions of hydrogen liquefiers were considered. A procedure for processing the experimental data on catalyst activity was presented for calculations of the laboratory and industrial hydrogen liquefiers working at different temperature levels based on these data.},

  title = {The Thermal and Electrical Conductivities of Some Pure Metals},
  volume = {107},
  abstract = {The relation between the thermal and electrical conductivities of me has for a long time engaged the attention of physicists. As far back as 1 Wiedemann and Franz propounded the law to the effect that the ratio of two conductivities was the same for all metals. In 1872 Lorenz, both on retical and experimental grounds, sought to establish that the above-mentio ratio was proportional to the absolute temperature. On the development the electron theory Drude, H. A. Lorentz, J. J. Thomson and others ha on the basis of various assumptions, arrived at the same conclusion as Lon Up to 1900, however, the experimental values were too uncertain to allow definite confirmation of the theory. In that year Jaeger and Diesselho published the result of their investigation, which gave directly the ratio of conductivities for a number of metals and alloys over the range 18\textdegree{} to 100\textdegree{} Lees has since, by an independent method, confirmed the values of Jaeger Diesselhorst for a number of metals at 18\textdegree{} C. and has carried the investigat own to \textemdash{}170\textdegree{} C. Meissner has experimented with some pure metals down \textemdash{}250\textdegree{} C. and Onnes and Holst even lower. The result of these investigations has been to show that between \textemdash{}100\textdegree{} C. + 100\textdegree{} C. the value of the function K/{$\lambda$}T (K and {$\lambda$} being the thermal and ectrical conductivities and T the absolute temperature), is sensibly the samer the pure metals, with perhaps a slight tendency to fall with decreasing temrature. Below \textemdash{}100\textdegree{} C., however, the function shows an increasingly rapid with temperature and a considerable divergence between individual metals, ove a temperature of + 100\textdegree{} C. very few determinations of thermal conictivity have been made, and the object of the present series of experiments is been to measure, in this region, the thermal and electrical conductivities a number of metals of the highest purity obtainable commercially.},

  abstract = {A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity without resistance below a superconducting transition temperature, Tc. The highest Tc that has been achieved to date is in the copper oxide system1: 133 kelvin at ambient pressure2 and 164 kelvin at high pressures3. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconductors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition temperatures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen\textendash{}Cooper\textendash{}Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving high Tc with no theoretical upper bound\textemdash{}all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron\textendash{}phonon coupling, and a high density of states4. These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen5,6, as hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron\textendash{}phonon coupling. Numerous calculations support this idea and have predicted transition temperatures in the range 50\textendash{}235 kelvin for many hydrides7, but only a moderate Tc of 17 kelvin has been observed experimentally8. Here we investigate sulfur hydride9, where a Tc of 80 kelvin has been predicted10. We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approximately 90 gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of superconductivity: a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero and a decrease of the transition temperature with magnetic field, with magnetic susceptibility measurements confirming a Tc of 203 kelvin. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of Tc in sulfur deuteride is suggestive of an electron\textendash{}phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is consistent with the Bardeen\textendash{}Cooper\textendash{}Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase responsible for high-Tc superconductivity in this system is likely to be H3S, formed from H2S by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other hydrogen-based materials.},

@article{bardeen_theory_1957,
  title = {Theory of {{Superconductivity}}},
  volume = {108},
  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, {$\hslash\omega$}. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average ({$\hslash\omega$})2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0\textdegree{}K to zero at Tc. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given., This article appears in the following collection:},

  shorttitle = {The Role of Magnetic Susceptibility in Magnetic Resonance Imaging},
  abstract = {The concept of magnetic susceptibility is central to many current research and development activities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); for example, the development of MR-guided surgery has created a need for surgical instruments and other devices with susceptibility tailored to the MR environment; susceptibility effects can lead to position errors of up to several millimeters in MR-guided stereotactic surgery; and the variation of magnetic susceptibility on a microscopic scale within tissues contributes to MR contrast and is the basis of functional MRI. The magnetic aspects of MR compatibility are discussed in terms of two levels of acceptability: Materials with the first kind of magnetic field compatibility are such that magnetic forces and torques do not interfere significantly when the materials are used within the magnetic field of the scanner; materials with the second kind of magnetic field compatibility meet the more demanding requirement that they produce only negligible artifacts within the MR image and their effect on the positional accuracy of features within the image is negligible or can readily be corrected. Several materials exhibiting magnetic field compatibility of the second kind have been studied and a group of materials that produce essentially no image distortion, even when located directly within the imaging field of view, is identified. Because of demagnetizing effects, the shape and orientation, as well as the susceptibility, of objects within and adjacent to the imaging region is important in MRI. The quantitative use of susceptibility data is important to MRI, but the use of literature values for the susceptibility of materials is often difficult because of inconsistent traditions in the definitions and units used for magnetic parameters\textemdash{}particularly susceptibility. The uniform use of SI units for magnetic susceptibility and related quantities would help to achieve consistency and avoid confusion in MRI.},

  issn = {0003-2700},
  abstract = {A new transducer concept in bioanalysis and biosensors, utilizing measurements of magnetic permeability, is reported. A model system based on dextran ferrofluid, concanavalin A immobilized to a carrier (Sepharose), and glucose was used to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Direct ferromagnetic detection of the dextran ferrofluid was achieved by using a measuring coil (transducer) in a Maxwell bridge. A sensitivity of 21 {$\mu$}V/({$\mu$}g Fe/mL) and a rsd value of 3.8\% were obtained (n = 5). It was also demonstrated that a small, non-ferromagnetic metabolite (glucose) could be detected using a competitive approach. With an increasing concentration of glucose (20-40 mM), we observed a decrease in the response (0.59-0.11 mV). Reference measurements performed on Sepharose without the biorecognition element, concanavalin A, showed no significant response (0.01 mV). Some potential advantages and drawbacks of this novel type of magnetic transducer are discussed. The advantages include very low interference from the sample matrix, as the transducer is only sensitive to ferromagnetic substances, which rarely are present in samples. In addition, it is suggested that these transducers should be free from fouling. The new transducers are proposed to provide the basis for a new group of affinity biosensors suitable for in vivo and in vitro use.},
