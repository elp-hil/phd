	\subsection{$B_0$ fields in low field NMR}
		For $B_0$ field generation, mostly solenoid coils with compensation windings on both ends
		were used. To find optimal lengths and numbers of layers, Matlab simulations were consulted.
		The measure considered was absolute field distribution inside a volume of
		$\SI{3}{\centi\meter}$ by  $\SI{3}{\centi\meter}$ by $\SI{3}{\centi\meter}$. To do so,
		fields were calculated in a grid of \todo{200 cubed} points. This data was analyzed in a
		histogram which yields results similar to the actual fourier transformed NMR signal.
		Using this representation and varying different parameters, an optimal geometry was
		found for different coils.
