\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}
	As a large part of this work consisted of hardware design and manufacturing, I will split the
	results section into sole hardware results and measurements with said hardware.
\section{Hardware}
	\subsection{Low field NMR}
		\subsubsection{Receive coils}
			Receive circuits provided q-factors of \todo{measure} resulting in resonances about
			$\SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}$ wide. Note that the connection to the NI DAQ introduces additional
			capacities and inductances that cannot be neglected especially in the higher frequency
			range above $\SI{100}{\kilo\hertz}$ where the coil's intrinsic capacities are
			comparatively small.
		\subsubsection{$\mathbf{B_0}$ coils}
			The manufactured $\mathrm{B_0}$ coils show fields (i.e. frequencies) as well as  linewidths in the order of magnitude the
			simulations predicted. Through manufacturing errors, and changes to the coil in long
			term use cases, the linewidths deteriorated. It is important to note that, at currents
			above $\SI{1}{\ampere}$, the $\mathrm{B_0}$ coil heated noiticabely. while the heating
			itself is unproblematic, the resulting exansion of the materials leads to an overall
			longer coil and thus lower fields \ref(fieldSolenoid). To avoid field shifts during
			measurements, the setup should therefore be in thermal equilibrium. This is especially
			relevant when switching fields during measurements using the programmable power supply.
		\subsection{Shims and programmable power supply}
			The three linear shims are settable via the programmable power supply and show
			their expected effect. The rotational position of the receive coil is relevant to the
			shims indicating they're working as intended. Using the added shim tool, line widths
			were reduced from $\approx \SI{250}{\hertz}$ to $\approx \SI{30}{\hertz}$ in the case of large samples of $\approx
			$\SI{40}{\milli\litre}. If the initial field was generated by a less homogeneous, more
			asymmetric coil in which no signal was visible without shims, signal was discovered and linewidths went down to
			$\approx \SI{50}{\hertz}$.
	\subsection{Sabre shuttling system}
		The system designed to transfer a sample between fields works as intended. Fluid losses are
		small and acceptable with about \todo{how much} lost within \todo{nn} shuttling cycles. The
		bubbling system works well and provides pH2 to the solution in large amounts. The pressure
		stability of the vessels has been tested to withstands up to $\SI{50}{\bar}$. Chemical
		resistance is good though resistance to pure pyridine is not given. While there was never
		any problem with the $\SI{}{\milli\Molar}$ pyridine concentrations used in the experiments, a
		neat pyridine batch showed to dissolve the PSU casing.
	\subsection{Fluxgate readout electronics}
		The readout electronics were designed to feature a wide range of amplifications for all
		three spatial dimensions. A 24 V DC power supply was fitted with a DC-DC-converter to
		provide the $\pm\SI{15}{\volt}$ to power the Fluxgate. Additionally the PCB board was fitted
		with the electronic parts (see \ref{sec:methodsFluxgate}). For testing purposes, a simple program
		using serial in and output to toggle the analog switches was written. All switches were
		successfully tested to work, though three had to be replaced at some point for malfunction.
		Apparently this was due to damage during assembly as the board is now working as expected.
	\subsection{Fluxgate calibration}
	The three spatial channels of the fluxgate sensor needed to be calibrated as to their intrinsic offsets as described in \ref{materialsMethods}. Data for X- and Y-channels are shown in figure \ref{fig:results:fluxgate:xysinus}
		\begin{figure}[h]

			\caption{Calibration data of X- and Y-channel. Each dataset in the key corresponds to a full rotation at one position in the MuMetal shield. The solid lines correspond to a sine fit to each dataset with phase, amplitude and offset as fitting parameters. Error bars are not displayed for better visibility.}
		\end{figure}
		The fit parameters shown in table \ref{table:results:calibrationFitParams} allow for calibration of X- and Y- channel by calculating the average offset for all Positions.

			\caption{Calibration of the Z-channel. Due to spatial limitations, no full rotation in z direction was possible. The two datasets represent one measurement in "upwards" ond one in "downwards" direction. The solid line represents the average of the positional averages of the two directions.}
		\end{figure}
		Using the data for calibration, the measurements of the X- and Y-channels can be used to plot a 2D-section of the field using the phase of the fit as the field direction and the amplitude as its magnitude. Both X- and Y-sensor are shown in figure \ref{fig:results:fluxgate:plotSpatial2d}. The absolute positions are indicated in the figure to enable comparison of the individual results in the same absolute position. The same data is also shown in a 3D plot (fig. \ref{fig:results:fluxgate:plotSpatial3d} to show the field progression inside the mu metal shield.

\section{Measurements}
	\subsection{Low field NMR}
	Low field spectra were acquired using different setups. The main modification between setups concerned the $B_0$ coil. The initially used solenoid coil showed linewidths of about 0.5 - \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}. Due to mechanical destruction of one coil and those rather wide lines, a new coil design was simulated and built \ref{simulations:DualHelmholtzArray} using Biot Savart calculations.

\section{Simulations}
		\subsection{Static magnetic field calculations}
			Using the Biot Savart law, a Matlab program to calculate the fields of current carrying conductors was implemented. Structural elements were mostly solenoids, but also saddle and helmholtz coils were considered.
			\subsubsection{solenoid coil}
				The coil used in the low field NMR system was calculated and the length of the compensation windings was optimized for field homogeniety. To do so, the field was calculated inside a $3 x 3 x 3 cm^3$ volume centered inside the coil and plotted as histograms binning fields. An algorithm analyzing over which field 80\% of the fields sampled spread was used as a marker
