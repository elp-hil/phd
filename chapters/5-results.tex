\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}
    As a large part of this work consisted of hardware design and manufacturing, I will split the results section into sole hardware results and results of measurements \textit{with} that hardware as well as commercially available machines. Additionally, simulation results will be added as a separate section.
\section{Hardware}
    \subsection{Low field NMR}
        \subsubsection{Receive coils}
            Receive circuits provided a Q-factor of \SI{128}{} as shown in figure \ref{fig:results:networkAnalysis}.  An additional, higher order resonance with worse Q factor can be seen to the right in the same plot at around \SI{460}{\kilo Hz}. The second graph shows the same measurement performed with the untuned saddle coil. The latter shows no significant dips and is thus considered broadband, i.e. as long as the RF-amplifiers power is sufficient, it can be used at arbitrary frequencies. Note that additional impedances are introduced into the system through the connection to the NI DAQ interface that cannot be neglected especially in the higher frequency range above $\SI{100}{\kilo\hertz}$ where the coil's intrinsic capacities are comparatively small. A measurement similar to the network analyzer measurement is shown in figure \ref{fig:results:niNetworkAnalysis}. A slight frequency shift can be obsereved, the signal amplitude does not provide a decent measure though and cannot provide a Q-factor as input voltages depend on the configuration of the TRX circuit.
            \begin{figure}

Note the strong dip in the syringe receive coil at around \SI{210}{\kilo\hertz} that was used to receive the NMR signal. The braodband transmit coil shows a flat frequency response.}
            \end{figure}
            \begin{figure}
                \label{fig:results:niNetworkAnalysis}

                \caption{ADC result of a pulse transmitted to the tuned receive coil. the central peak shows the resonance frequency of the coil. Similar to the actual network analysis measurement, a higher order resonance can be seen to the right at around \SI{500}{\kilo\hertz}.}
            \end{figure}
            Dual resonant coils for 1H and 13C signal reception did show a less prominent dip in both channels, while the additional channel (1H in most cases) \todo{ref methods} was affected more strongly by the changed circuitry.
        \subsubsection{$\mathbf{B_0}$ coils}
            The manufactured $\mathrm{B_0}$ coils show fields (i.e. frequencies) as well as  linewidths in the order of magnitude the simulations predicted (section \ref{sec:results:sim}). Through manufacturing errors, and changes to the coil in long term use cases, the linewidths deteriorated. It is important to note that, at currents above $\SI{1}{\ampere}$, the $\mathrm{B_0}$ coil heated noiticabely. while the heating itself is unproblematic, the resulting exansion of the materials leads to an overall longer coil and thus lower fields \ref{fieldSolenoid}. To avoid field shifts during measurements, the setup should therefore be in thermal equilibrium. This is especially relevant when switching fields during measurements using the programmable power supply.
    \subsection{Shims and programmable power supply}
        The three linear shims are adjustable via the programmable power supply and show their expected effect. The rotational position of the receive coil is relevant to the shims indicating they're working as intended (i.e. x- and y-shim currents need to be exchanged while z shim remains unchanged on a \SI{90}{\degree} rotation) . Manual shimming results are shown in figure \ref{chap:MaterialsAndMethods:lowFieldSpectrometer:shims}. The optimal results were achieved for currents of \SI{0}{\milli\ampere},  \SI{0}{\milli\ampere} and \SI{0}{\milli\ampere} for x-, y- and z-shim respectively. Using the added shim tool \todo{methRef}, line widths were reduced from $\approx \SI{250}{\hertz}$ to $\approx \SI{30}{\hertz}$ in the case of large samples of $\approx $\SI{40}{\milli\litre}. If the initial field was generated by a less homogeneous, more asymmetric coil in which no signal was visible without shims, signal was discovered and linewidths went down to $\approx \SI{50}{\hertz}$.
        \begin{figure}
            \label{fig:results:lowFieldSpectrometer:shims}
            \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{/figures/experiments/lowFieldSpectrometer/shims/shimXY.eps}
            \caption[Manual low field shimming]{Linear shimmung in x- and y-directions. Shimming was done manually: 1H spectra of water were recorded and evaluated as to their linewidth. Later, automatic shimming was implemented (see section \ref{chap:MaterialsAndMethods:lowFieldSpectrometer:shims}). Black dots indicate actual measuremet points, the red mesh is a spline interpolation of the measurement data. The same interpolation is shown as a colormap on the bottom of the graph where black color corresponds to narrowest lines and thus highest homogeniety.}
        \end{figure}
        The automatic discovery of the linewidth of a given measurement works well and yields results similar to the ones of a manual adjustment with a lot less user interaction. The fast fittingless linewidth detection based on interpolation yields linewidths within \SI{10}{\percent} of the fitted result if the SNR is sufficient, i.e. the maximum value can clearly be attributed to the water resonance.
    \subsection{Sabre shuttling system}
        The system designed to transfer a sample between fields works as intended. Fluid losses are small and thus
        acceptable with about \SI{25}{\percent} lost within \~15 shuttling cycles at high flow rates of \SI{20}{\litre
        \per\hour} and long bubbling times of 30 seconds per measurement i.e. \SI{8}{\minute} of pH2 flow through the
        sample. The bubbling system works well and provides pH2 to the solution in amounts large enough to generate
        polarization levels in the single digit percent range \ref{fig:results:highlyPolarized15Nspectrum}.
        \subsubsection{15N coil}
            The coil for 15N signal reception was matched and tuned to fit the requirements of the system. The network analyzer showed a q-factor of \todo{n} and a width of nn. Inside the small animal NMR, similar resonance widths of nn were observed while the attenuation was \SI{1}{\deci\bel}. Clear signal was visible using the 15N glycine phantom in a single shut measurement. Shimming reduced linewidths of the phantom to \SI{10}{\hertz}. Linewidths of the hyperpolarized 15N pyridine signal were 
        \subsubsection{Parahydrogen supply - bubbling}
            The newly constructed bubbling disk showed to provide hydrogen more homogenously than the previously used single hole supply. Different hole sizes provide similar flow for samples of different viscosities. The widening cylinder provides enough spcae for bubbles to burst and reduce losses due to fluid splashing into the venting line.
        \subsubsection{Pressure stability}
            The pressure stability of the vessels has been simulated to withstand \SI{200}{\bar} . I decided using a factor of safety of $\gamma = 4$. As expected, the most vulnerable part is the long side of the cylinder, but wall thickness of \SI{3}{\milli\meter} suffices for a factor of safety of 4 if the setup is operated at a maximum pressure of \SI{50}{\bar}.Experimentally, the pressure resistance of \SI{50}{\bar} was confirmed; no problems concerning material fatigue were observed whatsoever within a few thousand pressure cycles. Figure \ref{fig:results:bubblingReactorPressure} shows the displacement of the different parts at \SI{200}{\bar}. The maximum displacement is in the range of \SI{0.25}{\milli\meter} and is within the yield strengths of PSU.

            \end{figure}
            Chemical resistance to methanol- and ethanol-pyridine mixtures was as good as expected, though resistance to pure pyridine is not given. While there was never any problem with the pyridine concentrations  up to \SI{30}{\micro\Molar} used in the experiments, a neat pyridine batch showed to dissolve the PSU casing.\todo{ref discussion, other materials}
        \subsubsection{Mu metal shielding}
            The three layered mu metal shield reached fields of \SI{50}{\nano\tesla} insisde the stray field of the \SI{9.4}{\tesla} small animal MRI. In earth magnetic field, fields inside the shield went down even further to \todo{measure}.Manual degaussing was prone to errors and left the shields in different, non-comparable states. The workshop-built automatic degaussing power supply was capable of reducing those errors and generate a field of \SI{50}{\nano\tesla} reproducibly.The slew rate of \SI{0.25}{\ampere\per\second} showed to be sufficient in combination with an initial current of \SI{7}{\ampere}. The adaption to other shield sizes works automatically after a single calibration run.
        \subsubsection{Low field manipulation}
        Fields generated inside the shield were different using solenoid coil and helmholtz coil. Both coils were used to measure fields at the reactors position. As field steps using the power supply directly were in the range of \SI{213\pm 31}{\nano\tesla} per \SI{0.1}{\milli\ampere}, the lowest settable current, an additional \SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} resistor was used to reduce the current by a factor of 1000. The source was not usable in constant current mod, thus the voltage was set introducing a larger error to the current, but allowing for very precise adjustments to the current. Results that show the highly linear dependence of current (or voltage, ohmsch dep.) and magnetic field are shown in figures \ref{} and \ref{figures:results:helmholtzCoilsCenterField}
            \begin{figure}

                \caption{Field over voltage applied to the inner Helmholtz coil pair via a \SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} resistor to limit currents to values below the power supply's resolution.}
            \end{figure}
            
        \subsubsection{Shuttling reproducibility}
        \label{results:15N:shuttlingReproducibility}
            To ensure that the sample is removed completely from the high field side, spectra in both 'states' of the system were recorded (Figure \ref{fig:results:15N:shuttlingRemoval}). The residue left in the high field chamber after the shuttling procedure does not generate significant signal, but after maximizing the noise integral through phase shifts, the ratios upper limit $\frac{I_{in}}{I_{out}}$ can be estimated and corresponds to a maximum fluid volume of \SI{0.05}{ml}remaining in the high field chamber. Considering this fraction completely non-polarized, the overall polarization of a \SI{3}{ml} sample will be reduced by \SI{9999}{\percent} \ref{fig:results:15N:shuttlingReproducibility}.
            \begin{figure}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{/figures/experiments/15NSabre/reproducibility/spectraComparisonShuttle.eps}
                \caption[High field removal efficiency]{1H spectra of the high field reactor in the filled (blue) and empty (red) state. The filled state delivers a lot more signal as expected while the integration over the empty state spectrum shows a signal reduction of 1000.}
                \label{fig:results:15N:shuttlingRemoval}
            \end{figure}
            To test the reproducibility of the shuttling system, a hyperpolarized 1H pyridine sample was shuttled back and forth multiple times. The results of the measurement are shown in figure \ref{fig:results:15N:shuttlingReproducibility}. It can be seen that even in the setting used for testing with high flows of \SI{40}{\litre\per\minute} and extensive bubbling of \SI{30}{\second} per measurement cycle, the signal drops to only \SI{75}{\percent} after 15 shuttling procedures. Note that the actual losses may be even smaller as temperature effects are neglected in this measurement, but have been shown to have an effect on signal intensity in seperate experiments.

Note that the signal drops to about \SI{70}{\percent} of its initial value after 8 minutes of continuous hydrogen supply. The initial rise of signal during the first two minutes indicates a temperature effect unaccounted for.}
            \end{figure}
    \subsection{Fluxgate readout electronics}
        The readout electronics were designed to feature a wide range of amplifications for all three spatial dimensions. A 24 V DC power supply was fitted with a DC-DC-converter to provide the $\pm\SI{15}{\volt}$ to power the Fluxgate. Additionally the PCB board was fitted with the electronic parts (see \ref{sec:methodsFluxgate}). For testing purposes, a simple program using serial in and output to toggle the analog switches was written. All switches were successfully tested to work, though three had to be replaced at some point for malfunction.  Apparently this was due to damage during assembly as the board is now working as expected.
    \subsection{Fluxgate calibration}
        The three spatial channels of the fluxgate sensor needed to be calibrated as to their intrinsic offsets as described in \ref{materialsMethods}. Data for X- and Y-channels are shown in figure \ref{fig:results:fluxgate:xysinus}.
        \begin{figure}

            displayed for better visibility.}

        Using the data for calibration, the measurements of the X- and Y-channels can be used to plot a 2D-section of the field using the phase of the fit as the field direction and the amplitude as its magnitude. Both X- and Y-sensor are shown in figure \ref{fig:results:fluxgate:plotSpatial2d}. The absolute positions are indicated in the figure to enable comparison of the individual results in the same absolute position. The same data is also shown in a 3D plot (fig. \ref{fig:results:fluxgate:plotSpatial3d}) to show the field progression inside the mu metal shield.

\section{Measurements}
    \subsection{Low field NMR}
    \label{chap:results:lowFieldNMR}
        Low field spectra were acquired using different setups. The main modification between setups concerned the $B_0$ coil. The initially used solenoid coil showed linewidths of about 0.5 - \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}. Due to mechanical destruction of one coil and those rather wide lines, a new coil design was simulated and built \ref{fig:results:compensationWindOptimization} using Biot Savart calculations. While currents to generate the same field were higher by a factor of about 2, field homogeniety improved greatly and now shows linewidths of about \SI{18}{\hertz} (figure \ref{results:lowFieldSpectrometer:thinLine}). Flip angle calibrations for different pulse durations were calibrated and yielded the results shown in table \ref{table:results:FA}. These results were used in successive measurements with the low field NMR unless stated differently.

            \end{figure}
    \subsection{Sabre in water}
    For measurements of continuously hyperpolarized nicotinamide in deuterated water, the buildup of hyperpolarization was observed by TR variation. The results of these measurements are shown in figure \ref{results:lowFieldSpectrometer:SabreInWater:TRVariation}. TR was varied from \SI{1}{\second} to \SI{30}{\second}, the signal was stronger for longer TR and thus longer buildup time. The difference between TR~=~\SI{15}{\second} and TR~=~\SI{30}{\second} is already within the margin of error and implies that a plateau is reached in this domain. Note that a dummy scan was necessary for each TR measurement series to deplete the previously built hyperpolarization. The effective buildup rate can be calculated from these results (table \ref{table:results:TRvariation)}) and is shown in figure \ref{results:lowFieldSpectrometer:hpBuildup}. Using this data, the specific buildup rate, i.e. an effective $T_1$ was determined to be \SI{5.4\pm 0.2}{\second}. Similarly, for $H_2O$, a lower $T_1$ of \SI{2.4\pm0.2}{\second} was found at the \SI{5}{\milli\tesla} field.

    \subsection{Imaging of contiuously hyperpolarized solution}
    Using the Magritek Terranova, images of continuously hyperpolarized solutions were acquired. Using the watery Sabre solutions, imaging at low fields, specifically even at earth magnetic field, were possible, if previous to imaging prepolarization or, in this case, hyperpolarization fields of $\approx$ \SI{5}{\milli\tesla} were used. The results of such an image at earth magnetic field is shown in figure \ref{fig:results:earthFieldImage}. For the image, a polarization of \todo{calc} was calculated. The SNR of the much lower conscentrated nicotinamide \SI{1.3}{\milli\Molar} corresponding to \SI{12}{\milli\gram} nicotinamide in \SI{5}{\milli\litre} D2O) was higher than that of a much higher consentrated and larger volume doped water sample (\SI{20}{\milli\litre} of \SI{55}{\Molar} water) which showed SNR of 4.7.  \begin{figure}

Resolution is (\SI{1.6}{\milli\meter})$^2$ with an acquisition time of \SI{5}{\minute} \SI{20}{\second}.}
        \end{figure}
        Linewidths in single shot experiments after shimming were in the \SI{1}{\hertz} range and thus more narrow than the low field spectrometer's lines of equal molecules.
    \subsection{Sabre in cell solution and blood}
        Measurements in pure water yielded sufficient signal to try more biologically relevant substances. Cell culture solution (PTSD) was the first step forward and showed to already significantly reduce the polarization yield. Addition of \SI{0.5}{\milli\litre} of PTSD reduced the signal by a factor of 3. This already indicated that with human blood as an addition to the solution, the performance would not be better if not worse. Measurements confimed this suspicion, the signal showed to drop by a factor of \~8 after injection of 0.3 ml of human blood into the solution already. Adding \SI{0.5}{\milli\litre} of blood completely diminishes the signal. SNR for these measurements was comparably low to begin with where

    \subsection{Liposomes and Sabre}
        The results of cell culture solution and human blood addition to a working, hyperpolarized sample suggested that other approaches were necessary to achieve hyperpolariation in biologically relevant surroundings. The previously described method of encapsulation of substrate and catalyst in double layered liposomes. While the liposomes formed, the size distribution according to the lipochemists was broader than usual. \todo{plot results if available} The experiments trying to hyperpolarize the liposomal structures failed and it showed that the addition of the components used in the generation of liposomes into a working hyperpolarized solution already depleted the signal to a non-detectabel level. Different solvents and substrates were tested in combinations but did not yield any observable signal.
    \subsection{15N Sabre}
        $^{15}\mathrm{N}$ labeled substances were used to generate high polarization on the substrate in \si{\nano\tesla} fields. Results are shown here and include spectroscopic as well as imaging experiments.
    \subsubsection{Pressure dependence}
        To see the influence of the pH2 pressure during bubbling, the same experiment was repeated multiple times at different pressures. The results of these measurements are shown in figure \ref{}. A mostly linear pressure dependence can be estimated from the data indicating that the catalytic reaction is still in the low concentration regime.
    \subsubsection{Flow dependence}
        Similar to pressures, flow rates have been varied to estimate their effect on the reaction's efficiency. Here, other than for the pressure measurements, flow was not a parameter linearly connected to signal intensity. As flow showed to change bubble sizes as well as the number of flow channels building, a more complex behaviour is expected and shown in figure \ref{}.
    \subsection{Magnetic field dependence}
        Magnetic field dependence of the polarization was measured by adjusting the field using the solenoid coil and dual helmholtz pair mounted inside the shields. The currents necessary for optimum fields were a function of the residual magnetization of the shield. Measurements of polarization and current-field correlation were conducted separately. The result shows that the field reduction generated by the shielding is large enough to surpass the optimal polarization fields as the signal drops between the two maxima that show up for two current flow directions. The asymmetry of the distribution is due to residual magnetic field of the shield, it generates both a shift of the 'mirror axis' and an overall deformation of the distribution depending on the field homogeniety.
    \subsection{$\mathrm{T_1}$ and $\mathrm{T_2}$ measurements}
        The relaxation times are relevant to subsequent measurements of spectra and images and were measured for both 15N-Glycine phantom and a neat, thermally polarized 15N-Pyridine sample. $\mathrm{T}_1$ was found to be \SI{55\pm 3}{\second} whereas $\mathrm{T}_2$ was only \SI{250\pm 20}{\milli\second}.
    \subsection{Polarization measurements}
        The scheme used in the first, preliminary tests provided polarizations in the range of \todo{range}. This value was drastically improved by using a more sophisticated approach, i.e. an automated high pressure shuttling system to generate high polarizations reproducibly and even at high concentrations to generate high magnetization.
        Polarizations in high concentration regimes and under otherwise optimal parameters (i.e. high flow of \SI{50}{\litre\per\minute}, high pressures of \SI{50}{\bar}, field at \SI{340}{\nano\tesla}) the maximum polarization measured was $\mathrm{P} = 4\% \pm 0.2 \%$. The paramter that was not controllable in this setup but does have a substantial influence on the magnetizatioin yield was the temperature of the sample that decreased while parahydrogen flowed through the volatile methanol used as solvent, see \ref{cd:sabreShuttling:tempControl} for a closer discussion.
        The two methods used for quantification - compariso to thermal signal, the more reliable, but very slow method, and comparison to the 15N glycine phantom, less reliable per se but fast - yield similar results if match and tune of the coil are readjusted after echanging the sample for the phantom. This ensures a similar flip angle used in the phantom measurement and thus a decent estimate of polarization.
    \subsection{Nanotesla field measurements}
        The field inside the Mu Metal shielding was measured without any current flowing in the B0 coil as well as with the coil turned on. Measurements showed different results for the solenoid coil used in the beginning and the later used helmholtz coil.
    \subsection{High field Sabre}
        High field sabre results from the IMTEK \SI{600}{\mega\hertz} spectrometer were obtained. These results show that small amounts of substrate can be hyperpolarized in situ both through the less efficient spontaneous hyperpolarization as well as through pulsed hyperpolarization (Light-Sabre, \todo{ref}).
\section{Simulations}
        \label{sec:results:sim}
        \subsection{Static magnetic field calculations}
            Using the Biot Savart law, a Matlab program to calculate the fields of current carrying conductors was implemented. Structural elements were mostly solenoids, but also saddle and helmholtz coils were considered.
            \subsubsection{Solenoid Coil}
            The magnetic field of the coil used in the low field NMR system was calculated and the length of the compensation windings was optimized for field homogeniety.
                \begin{figure}
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{/figures/simulations/B0/solenoidCoil/compensationWinds.eps}
                    \caption[Compensation wind optimization]{Histograms of the magnetic field strength. From left to right, number of compensation windings rise. This leads to a field increase and change in homogeniety. Central winding numbers are the most homogenous ones discovered.}
                \label{fig:results:compensationWindOptimization}
            \end{figure}
            It can be seen that different numbers of turns for the optimization windings change both the overall field strength (simple superposition) as well as its homogeniety. Binning was chosen rough at first to easily discover the overall region of high homogeniety and then refined to streamline in this region.
            The field of the optimized case coil is plotted in figure \todo{ref} both in a plane perpendicular to and parallel to the magnetic fields main direction. Despite the simulations considering to solenoidal character of the coil, rotation of the plane parallel to the magnetic field did not affect homogeniety greatly (\todo{make figs}). The overall shape of the field histogram is not a lorentian; this confirms what was found for rather wide peaks (> \SI{100}{\hertz} linewidth) fitted with lorentians that showed poor resemblance to a lorentian distribution.
        \subsubsection{Helmholtz Array}
        The previously used program was used again to simulate the field of the helmholtz array used in later experients. The simulations were used to optimize the parameters for the setup before manufacture. Simulation steps for the distance between the two helmholtz pairs are shown in figure \ref{fig:results:optimizationSteps}.
        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{/figures/simulations/B0/helmholtzCoil/optimizationSteps.pdf}
            \caption{Optimization steps of the two distances of inner and outer coil pair. Note the small range in the lower graph that is probably already inside the margin of error of manufacture and actual positioning.}
            \label{fig:results:optimizationSteps}
        \end{figure}
        Note that the figures shown here do not include the optimization of the current ratio between the two coil pairs. The simulation results concerning the positions of the coils are shown in figure \ref{fig:results:distanceVariation}. A closeup of the central region is plotted in figure \ref{figure:results:fieldSpread}. The optimal result is marked, and the field homogeniety is plotted for this result (figure \todo{ref, fig}). Comparing the field map to figure \ref{} shows a factor \todo{nn} improvement.
        \begin{figure}
           \centering
           \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{/figures/simulations/B0/helmholtzCoil/distanceVariation.pdf}
           \label{fig:results:distanceVariation}
           \caption{Optimization of the coils distances by 'fminsearchbnd'. Note that the current ratio of the coils was also varied in the simulations, but kept constant for the recording of the data shown here. The value displayed is the ratio of the field spread in the active volume of the coil and the absolute field strength. The black area in the center is where field homogeniety is highest.}
        \end{figure}
        \begin{figure}
            \includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{/figures/simulations/B0/helmholtzCoil/fieldSpread.eps}
            \label{fig:results:fieldSpread}
            \caption{3D plot of the central region of high homogeniety shown in \ref{fig:results:distanceVariation}. Note that the distance variation of the inner coil has a more prominent effect on field homogeniety than the outer one. The minimum value found is a relative spread of $5\cdot 10^{-5}$.}
        \end{figure}
        The lowest value found is a relative spread of $4.6 \cdot 10^{-5}$ corresponding to a linewidth of \SI{12.5}{\hertz}. Experimentally, similar values were observed (see chapter \ref{chap:results:lowFieldNMR}). Small variations in the distances lead to strong decrease in homogeniety especially for the inner coil pair - \SI{0.1}{\milli\meter} variations already make up for a decrease of 3 in homogeniety in the inner coil pair while for the outer pair, the same variation makes up for an increase by a factor of 0.2 only. Overall, exact positioning is thus crucial, going especially for the inner pair. The dual helmholtz design has thus increased homogeniety to linewidths smaller than those of the solenoid with compensation windings and linear shims. Adding shims to the helmholtz array is possible and encouraged for future work and will probably further improve homogeniety.
        \subsubsection{Nicotinamide level anti crossings using the spin framework}
        The spin framework developed in this group was used to calculate level anti crossings for nicotinamide and IR-IMes as a spin system. The results obtained are similar to results previously published concerning pyridine and IR-IMes \todo{ref}. In figure \ref{figure:results:simulation:nicotinamideSpinSystem} the polarization levels are plotted against field and contact time of the complex (i.e. spin evolution time). These results indicate highest polarizations at \SI{4.9}{\milli\tesla} which is close to the fields obtained in the pyridine simulations. A contact time of \SI{10}{\milli\second} seems best to generate high polarizations and needs to be adjusted indirectly via sample temperatures. These results were used to adjust experimental parameters in the best possible way and were confirmed through field and temperature variations (section \ref{chapter:results:lowFieldNMR})
